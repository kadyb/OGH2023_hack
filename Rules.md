# Hackathon rules

1. You can submit the results individually or in pairs
2. You must be registered on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
3. Finally, you must send the results as a `.csv` file and a reproducible notebook
4. If you agree, we can make your notebook public in the hackathon repository
5. Maximum of three submissions per day are allowed
6. Three notebooks with the highest validation metric are subject to final evaluation. The best work is selected by the jury

## Notes

1. Set the randomness seed in the script
2. Make sure your model returns all land cover categories
3. Make sure you use the same coordinate reference systems:
    * Polish National Geodetic Coordinate System 1992 (`EPSG:2180`)
    * Universal Transverse Mercator Coordinate System Zone 34N (`EPSG:32634`)
4. State of the art classification algorithms (generally pixel-based):
    * random forest
    * gradient boosting
    * support vector machine
5. Do not waste time on tuning the model that improves the score by 0.00001; focus more on feature engineering
6. If you have any questions (or problem) about the hackathon, feel free to ask on the [hackathon](https://mattermost.opengeohub.org/poznan-2023/channels/hackathons) channel on Mattermost
