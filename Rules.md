# Hackathon rules

1. You can submit the results individually or in pairs
2. Finally, you must send the results as a `.csv` file and a reproducible notebook
3. Notebooks will be available to the public after the hackathon (??????)
4. Three submissions per day are allowed
5. Three notebooks with the highest validation metric are subject to final evaluation. The best work is selected by the jury
6. Don't waste time on tuning the model by 0.00001 score, focus more on feature engineering


## Notes

1. Set the randomness seed in the script
2. Make sure your model returns all land cover categories
3. Make sure you use the same coordinate reference systems
4. State of the art classification algorithms (generally pixel based):
    * random forest
    * gradient boosting
    * support vector machine
