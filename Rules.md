# Hackathon rules

1. You can submit the results individually or in pairs
2. You must registered on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
3. Finally, you must send the results as a `.csv` file and a reproducible notebook
4. Notebooks will be available to the public after the hackathon (??????)
5. Maximum of three submissions per day are allowed
6. Three notebooks with the highest validation metric are subject to final evaluation. The best work is selected by the jury

## Notes

1. Set the randomness seed in the script
2. Make sure your model returns all land cover categories
3. Make sure you use the same coordinate reference systems
4. State of the art classification algorithms (generally pixel-based):
    * random forest
    * gradient boosting
    * support vector machine
5. Do not waste time on tuning the model that improves the score by 0.00001; focus more on feature engineering
